# team17-project1
For our group project, we created a site that generates a random book for you to read. 

The recomended book is based off of any keyword you choose to imput. 

A book is then generated from Google's Books API. 

If you decided that you like the recommended book, you have the option to save the book to your list. 

In addition to the Google API, we also incorparted a random quote generator. 

This can be found on the right hands side along with the staff recomendations, and your list !
